This document describes a basic design for how to handle objects such as:
structures, creatures, items, floors, roof, resources

Tile data layout:

[0]				[1]						[2]			[3]
				[PathBlockingResources]	[Roof]
[structureFloor][Structures]						
[items]			[Living]

Tile
{
	Floor floor;
	Item item;
	Resource resource;//Cannot have a resource and a structure part in the same tile...
	StructurePart structurePart;
	Roof roof;
}

//Structures must h2ave all of their parts interconnected. There must be a part adjacent (left, right, up, down) from each part.
class Structure
{
string name;
Guid ownerID;//Could be playerID, it could be empty if it is unclaimed, or it could be claimed by an AI faction.

Structure(string name, string ownerID, List<StructurePart> parts);

List<StructurePart> Parts;

}

//A part of a structure.
class StructurePart
{
Structure parent;
Guid partID;
int durability;
Point2D location;
bool walkable;

}
